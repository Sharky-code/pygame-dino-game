# a silly pygame dino game i decided to make with my friend for fun

Hey James, so this is what I made:
I decided not to put it in outlook because it's fun in github.

Basically i made it so that you can jump with UP\_ARROW and you can adjust the gravity.
A lot of things are still not implemented. For example:
- need to add ducking animation
- need to add the birds
- need to get the cactus textures
