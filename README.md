# a silly pygame dino game i decided to make with my friend for fun

Hey James, so this is what I made:
I decided not to put it in outlook because it's fun in github.

Basically i made it so that you can jump with UP\_ARROW and you can adjust the gravity.
A lot of things are still not implemented. For example:
- When you change the dimensions bigger than the image size, It will just show it the same as how the image was
- You can't scale the window (its small as hell rn)
- There's no obstacle, there's only player jumping and gravity XD
